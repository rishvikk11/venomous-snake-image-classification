# Image Classification of Venomous Snakes

Overview:

This project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques to classify images of venomous and non-venomous snakes with high accuracy. By combining automated web scraping and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model achieves a robust performance, aiding in applications like wildlife identification and safety assessments.

Features:

- Automated Image Collection: Scraped and collected a dataset of 7,000+ snake images using Selenium, streamlining browser task automation and batch downloading.
- Deep Learning Model: Developed and trained a CNN using TensorFlow and Keras to classify venomous vs. non-venomous snakes with 89% accuracy.

Tools and Technologies:

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries and Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, Selenium
- Dataset: Custom dataset of snake images collected via automated web scraping

Key Achievements:

- Automated the dataset creation process, significantly reducing manual effort and time required for data preparation.
- Optimized the CNN architecture to achieve high classification accuracy while minimizing computational overhead.

How It Works:

- Data Collection: Selenium was used to scrape snake images from multiple web sources, focusing on venomous and non-venomous snake categories.
- Model Training: A CNN model was designed and trained on the dataset to identify patterns distinguishing venomous from non-venomous snakes.
- Evaluation: The model was tested on unseen data, demonstrating an accuracy of 89%.

Future Enhancements:

- Expand the dataset to include more diverse species and improve generalization.
- Integrate real-time classification capabilities via a user-friendly interface.
